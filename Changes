Revision history for MyTAP
==========================

1.0   2018-07-21
-------------------------
This is a massive rewrite and extension of the available tests with thanks to @animalcarpet.
This version also has version specific tests and uses slightly different tests based
on  the MySQL version.
This version is tested on MySQL 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7

0.07  2018-06-18
-------------------------
* col_has_unique_index, col_hasnt_unique_index added to test for
  the existence or absence of a unique index.
* tests added for the new functions.
* syntax errors fixed in the tests for the has[nt]_function and
  has[nt]_procedure functions.
* runtests.sh script now has a filter option.

0.06  2017-06-18
-------------------------
* has_table and hasnt_table moved to separate file
* has_trigger and hasnt_trigger added to test if a table has a
  certain trigger
* tests added for the new functions

0.05  2016-06-22T19:25:12
-------------------------
* col_has_pos_in_named_index, col_has_pos_in_named_index added to test
  for index keys that combine multiple columns.
* tests added for the new functions.

0.04  2016-01-01T21:55:58
-------------------------
* col_has_named_index, col_hasnt_named_index added to allow index key names
  that differ from the column name. Defaults to column name.
* tests added for the new functions

0.03  2015-04-26T08:12:37
-------------------------
* _has_table reworked to distinguish between views and tables
* has_table and hasnt_tabel reworked to allow custom description
* has_view, hasnt_view, has_security_invoker, has_security_definer tests added
* all kinds of column related tests added
* has_function, hasnt_function, has_procedure, hasnt_procedure added

Note: these tests are only tested on MySQL 5.5x

0.02  2010-08-30T17:36:29
-------------------------
* Modified exception-throwing code to always clear out the cached data before
  dying. Doesn't cover cases where the code being tested dies, but at least it
  covers our own intentional deaths.
* Fixed `DROP` lines to be terminated with "//" instead of ";". Seems like
  some versions of MySQl didn't mind the semicolon, but others did.


0.01  2010-07-28T18:37:03
-------------------------
* Initial public release with core functionality ported from
  [pgTAP](http://pgtap.org/).
