Revision history for MyTAP
==========================

0.03  2015-04-26T08:12:37
-------------------------
* _has_table reworked to distinguish between views and tables
* has_table and hasnt_tabel reworked to allow custom description
* has_view, hasnt_view, has_security_invoker, has_security_definer tests added
* all kinds of column related tests added
* has_function, hasnt_function, has_procedure, hasnt_procedure added

Note: these tests are only tested on MySQL 5.5x

0.02  2010-08-30T17:36:29
-------------------------
* Modified exception-throwing code to always clear out the cached data before
  dying. Doesn't cover cases where the code being tested dies, but at least it
  covers our own intentional deaths.
* Fixed `DROP` lines to be terminated with "//" instead of ";". Seems like
  some versions of MySQl didn't mind the semicolon, but others did.


0.01  2010-07-28T18:37:03
-------------------------
* Initial public release with core functionality ported from
  [pgTAP](http://pgtap.org/).
